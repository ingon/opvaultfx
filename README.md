# opvaultfx

`opvaultfx` is a [1password vault](https://support.1password.com/opvault-design/) reader implemented in Java & JavaFX, with the following features:
* Security. It attempts to achive that by:
    - Zero copy/allocation JSON parsing. OPVault uses JSON for representing things, and by using https://github.com/ingon/json-zero we
    extract only the data we need, after which the in-memory source is zeroed out.
  * All passwords are stored encrypted in memory, decrypted only when needed (for copy/fill)
  * Every bit of information is kept in memory for a minimum time, then zeroed out.
* Works on linux
* Design. Attempts to implement google's material design (with mixed results)
* Quick filter to find the items
* Supports TOTP (HOTP is not supported since it requires write access to the vault)

## Running
